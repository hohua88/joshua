    Hello,

    Upon further review of the activity associated with your Apple Developer Program membership, we have determined that your membership, or a membership associated with your account, has been used for dishonest or fraudulent activity. Therefore, your Apple Developer Program account has been flagged for removal. 

    If you would like to appeal this termination to the [App Review Board](http://developer.apple.com/appstore/resources/approval/contact.html), you must do so within 14 calendar days. When submitting your appeal, be sure to select “I would like to appeal an app rejection or app removal” from the drop-down menu on the Contact the App Review Team page. You may only submit one appeal per Apple Developer Program account; any duplicate appeals you submit will be closed without review. If you do not appeal within 14 calendar days, your Apple Developer Program membership will be terminated and all apps associated with your account will be removed from the App Store.

    We found that your app is in direct violation of the [Apple Developer Program License Agreement](https://developer.apple.com/terms/), which states:

    “You will not, directly or indirectly, commit any act intended to interfere with the Apple Software or Services, the intent of this Agreement, or Apple’s business practices including, but not limited to, taking actions that may hinder the performance or intended use of the App Store, Custom App Distribution, or the Program (e.g., submitting fraudulent reviews of Your own Application or any third party application, choosing a name for Your Application that is substantially similar to the name of a third party application in order to create consumer confusion, or squatting on application names to prevent legitimate third party use).”

    During our review, we found a pattern of manipulative or misleading behavior that violates the Apple Developer Program License Agreement. These behaviors can include, but are not limited to, inaccurate metadata describing your app or service, misleading app content, engaging in inauthentic ratings and reviews manipulation, providing misleading customer support responses, providing misleading responses in Resolution Center, engaging in misleading purchasing or bait-and-switch schemes, and other dishonest or fraudulent activity within or outside of the app.

    We do not disclose the specific findings of our investigations into Apple Developer Program membership accounts, and we have no additional information to share with you at this time. You can appeal this decision with the [App Review Board](http://developer.apple.com/appstore/resources/approval/contact.html) at any time over the next 14 calendar days. When submitting your appeal, be sure to select “I would like to appeal an app rejection or app removal” from the drop-down menu on the Contact the App Review Team page.

    Best regards,

    App Store Review
